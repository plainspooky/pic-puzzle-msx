PicPuzzle
=========

PicPuzzle is a puzzle game written using MSX-BASIC and
[MSX-BASIC Kun](https://www.generation-msx.nl/software/ascii-corporation/msx-basic-kun/721/)
as well. It's a kind of [15 Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_Puzzle)
game, something I used to play when I was a kid, but instead of squares
labeled with numbers I decided to play using pictures from
[Vincent van Gogh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh)
just like in jigsaws.

I'm using eight paintings from the artist:

- [Bedroom in Arles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedroom_in_Arles)
- [Fishing Boats on the Beach at Saintes-Marie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saintes-Maries_(Van_Gogh_series))
- [Langlois Bridge in Arles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langlois_Bridge_at_Arles)
- [The Night Café](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Caf%C3%A9)
- [The Red Vineyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Vineyard)
- [The Starry Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night)
- [Wheat Field with Cypresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Field_with_Cypresses)
- [The Yellow House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yellow_House)
